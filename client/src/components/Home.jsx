    <h1 className="home-component-title">New York City's Iconic Skyline and Architecture</h1>
      <div className="home-body-container">
    <p className="home-component-body">New York City has played a prominent role in the development of the skyscraper which has shifted many commercial and residential districts from low-rise to high-rise. The City has architecturally significant buildings in a wide range of styles spanning distinct historical and cultural periods.  Since 1890, ten of those built in the city have held the title of world's tallest.
      
        New York City went through two very early high-rise construction booms, the first of which spanned the 1890s through the 1910s, and the second from the mid-1920s to the early 1930s.  During this period 44 skyscrapers over 492 feet (150 m) were builtâ€”including the Singer Building, Met Life Tower, Woolworth Building, 40 Wall Street, the Chrysler Building, and the Empire State Building, each of which was the tallest in the world at the time of its completion, the last remaining so for forty years.

        From 1930-1931 the title of tallest in the world changed 3 times with 40 Wall Street being surpassed only weeks later by the Chrysler building which was then eclipsed by the Empire State Building by over 200 feet.  In total, the city has seen the rise of over 100 completed and topped-out structures of at least 650 feet tall.

        The recent construction boom and the development of Hudson yards has again transformed the skyline with ever taller and more complex structures.  

        This intention of this site is to honor the historically significant, the iconic and the tallest buildings in the city.  Feel free to add your own to the list of iconic buildings.
